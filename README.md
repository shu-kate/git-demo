# Docker CI/CD Demo Project

This is a simple HTML application containerized using Docker and automated using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

## What I implemented

- Created a simple HTML web application
- Wrote a Dockerfile to containerize the application using nginx
- Configured GitHub Actions workflow to automatically build Docker image on every push
- Verified successful automated build pipeline

## Technologies Used

- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- GitHub
- HTML
- Nginx

## CI/CD Workflow

Whenever I push code to the repository:

1. GitHub Actions automatically triggers
2. Docker image is built
3. Build success confirms application is container-ready

## Learning Outcome

This project helped me understand:

- Docker containerization
- CI/CD pipeline automation
- GitHub Actions workflow setup
- Version control using Git and GitHub
